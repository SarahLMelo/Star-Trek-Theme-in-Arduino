# Star-Trek-Theme-in-Arduino
An Arduino program to play Star Trek Theme

This is one of my first projects. We were assigned the task of making a buzzer play a piece of music using Arduino. Therefore, I chose one of my favorite childhood shows theme: Star Trek: TNG.
I read the violin sheet and translated every note to Arduino programming language. Therefore, I was able to use a buzzer and an Arduino board to complete the task.
